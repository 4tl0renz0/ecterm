    <h1>Planned features</h1>
    <article>
      <p>First, a disclaimer. In all fairness, ECTerm isn't very far along (as of November 7th, 2021), so this article focuses more on planned features.</p>
      <h2>Basic terminal usage</h2>
      <p>Adding commands like <code>cd</code>, <code>dir</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, etc. I'm thinking about including some (crude) file creation, file readout and content appending commands as well.</p>
      <h2>Basic text editor</h2>
      <p>I might just package in something like vi, or maybe build my own from scratch.<br>
      (Writing this made me think; "what about the user's choice?")</p>
      <h2>Package manager</h2>
      <p><strong>This would probably be the hardest part.</strong></p>
      <p>I mean, getting external programs to work and be able to be executed? While not running a different terminal process?<br>
      ...though, I should be able to figure something out.</p>
