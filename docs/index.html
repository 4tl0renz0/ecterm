    <article>
      <p><strong>Now we're getting started.</strong></p>
      <p>ECTerm is designed to be a system-alternative terminal with a better feel to it. Originally, ECTerm was a personal project concept to replace the default windows terminal, but over of time and planning, it easily became less of a concept- and more of a reality.</p>
      <p>ECTerm runs natively in your terminal, letting you have your original terminal open without the hassle of having a whole other GUI.</p>
      <p><strong>Programmed in Rust</strong>, a programming language that <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages" target="_blank">ranked "most loved" for the fifth year in a row in Stack Overflow's Developer Survey</a>, optimized for extra speed and stability, ECTerm will run fast, smooth, and free.</p>
