# Overview
A custom terminal built in Rust, inspired from one of my previous projects.

## Details
ECTerm (pronounced "EK-TURM") is a terminal (or more like a concept of one) that I started building on a while ago, along with some others.

### What's up with the name?
ECTerm is actually an acronym, standing for **E**arth **C**lones **T**erminal. ECTerm was originally from EC.OS (for **E**arth **C**lones **O**perating **S**ystem, a set of programs which vaugely resembled an OS, until I rebranded it to ECCellsior, and then I decided I'd just do the one program that I had: ECTerm).

### Earth Clones?

"Earth Clones" is short for Earth Clone Troopers And Company, or ECTAC. ECTAC was the name of my own made-up faction of my four [Star Wars Clone Troopers, with an earth-like armor texture](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DdRSzGMpL._AC_SL1300_.jpg). At that time, it was called ECT. When I recieved a set of four mandolorian lego minifigures and added them to the faction, I changed the name to ECTAC- and it stuck.

The original idea was to create some programs that they could or would use, but as my program (and coding skills) evolved, it became something more- and it became even more when I discovered GitHub, and I could store my files on the cloud.

## Function
As I said earlier, ECTerm is just a custom terminal concept that I've become interested in.
